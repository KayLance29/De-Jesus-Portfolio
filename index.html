                        <p>A few months after graduating with my bachelor’s degree, I felt the need for further growth and improvement. 
                            To deepen my understanding of the field and better prepare myself for my future career, I decided to pursue 
                            a Master’s in Information Technology. This will allow me to acquire advanced knowledge and skills that I can apply 
                            effectively in my profession.</p>

                        <p>
                        I studied at Saint Paul University Philippines during my junior and senior high school years, 
                        where I chose the STEM strand because I’ve always aspired to become an engineer. My high school studies 
                        helped me develop a variety of skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving, which I was able to apply 
                        when I transitioned to college. These skills laid a strong foundation for my engineering studies and helped me succeed academically.

                        <p>I studied for my bachelor's degree at the University of Saint Louis Tuguegarao and chose to pursue 
                            a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering because of my strong interest in technology and problem-solving. 
                            I have always been fascinated by how computers and systems work, and I wanted to gain the knowledge and skills to design, 
                            develop, and improve both hardware and software. </p>
